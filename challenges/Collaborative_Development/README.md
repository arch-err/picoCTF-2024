*My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?*

## Solution
1. Also a git challenge. A python file that's been worked on that is supposed to print the flag.
2. There are 4 branches, 1 master and 3 feature-branches. Merge in the feature branches and run the code to get the flag.


## Flag
**Flag:** `picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_7ffa0077}`
