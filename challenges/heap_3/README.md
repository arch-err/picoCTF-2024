# heap_3
*This program mishandles memory. Can you exploit it to get the flag?*

## Solution
1. The intro-text hints at a use-after-free vulnerabililty. After some research on UAFs I figured out how to get the flag, see [solve.py](./solve.py)
2. `./solve.py`


## Flag
**Flag:** `picoCTF{now_thats_free_real_estate_a11cf359}`
