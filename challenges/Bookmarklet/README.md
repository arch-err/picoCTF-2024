# Bookmarklet
*Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?*

## Solution
1. We're given a link to a website that shows us a ***bookmarklet***. I suppose I could make a bookmark to run it but that seems like too much of a hassle, let's just run the given js code and get the flag.

## Flag
**Flag:** `picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_18d2fa20}`
