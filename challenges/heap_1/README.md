*Can you control your overflow?*

## Solution
1. We just gotta overwrite the "secret key" with something, I just correctly guessed that we should set it to `pico`, this can be done by inserting `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapico` into our writeable buffer. This will overflow our buffer and write over the "secret key".
