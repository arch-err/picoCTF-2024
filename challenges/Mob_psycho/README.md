*Can you handle APKs?*

## Solution
1. The answer is no. I can't handle APKs. Not yet at least...
2. Alright, it seems like APKs are "just" zip-archives. After some looking around i find a file called "flag.txt"... And then there's a hex-encoded representation of the flag in the file, of course... FFSs, I didn't even get to learn APK forensics, that was just lame...


## Flag
**Flag:** `picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_a3eb5ac2}`
